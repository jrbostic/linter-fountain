Atom Fountain Linter
====================

Fountain linter is a linting tool for the [fountain screenwriting markup language](https://fountain.io/) .

This package is extremely immature and in search of new/useful cases to apply linting to.  

Please liberally [log any desired linting features or suggestions](https://github.com/jrbostic/linter-fountain/issues) that would be useful for your workflow.  Particularly, any real-world "gotcha" moments with the syntax would be great sources with which to instigate a new ticket!
